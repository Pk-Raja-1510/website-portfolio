                Programming languages are commonly used to create web
                applications, software, AI, etc. but the Swift programming
                language is created to develop iOS applications. This is an
                open-source programming language and highly secured also. If you
                are wishing to start your career as a swift developer then this
                content will give a brief idea about this precious language and
                give your feedback at the end of this content.
              </p>
              <h3>What is Swift?</h3>
              <p>
                Swift is an easy-to-learn and powerful programming language. It
                is used to create applications for iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS.
                In top-ranked IT industries, the need for swift developers is
                increased and their pay is also high when compared to the
                others. This programming language was made by Apple and is
                compatible with the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks. When
                compared to the predecessor and Objective-C, Swift is less
                affected by mistakes in the code. This makes the swift safe and
                secure also easier to understand. It is built with the LLVM
                compiler framework, which is included in Xcode 6 and later
                versions.
                <br></br>

              <h3>Implementations</h3>
              <p>
                This is an open-source programming language and it can be ported
                to the web. IBM made iconic frameworks like Kitura, Perfect, and
                Vapour. Apple provides Server APIs to Swift developers to play a
                key role. Swift is a part of RemObjects Software Element
                Compiler and there is another free implementation of Swift that
                can interact with (.NET), Java, and the android platform.
              </p>
              <h3>Top 5 Features of Swift</h3>
              <p>
                Swift has become widely chosen to program, and it is highly
                recommended by professional developers. Now we are going to see
                what makes Swift an interesting programming language to learn.
              </p>

                  <h3>Readability </h3>
                  <p>
                    Swift is not like the C program so it is not necessary to
                    use @symbol in front of every objective-c and object-related
                    keyword. So this allows Swift to combine all the keywords
                    together. Swift eschews the traditional programming system.
                    the developer has no need to use semicolons to terminate
                    lines or parentheses to close if/else statements. It is easy
                    to understand the code so the developer can easily spot the
                    error.

                  <h3>Safety</h3>
                  <p>
                    Commonly a programming language that is hard to understand
                    will be highly secure but Swift is easy to understand at the
                    same time quite changing to break the security gateways.
                    That's why It is very hard to access the applications which
                    are developed with Swift. For example, Java is one of the
                    leading programming languages and it is very hard to learn
                    and understand its coding structure. At the same time, java
                    is a highly secure programming language. Python is also one
                    of the leading programming languages but it is very easy to
                    read and understand its coding structure. At the same time
                    python is not case-sensitive so there is a lot of chance to
                    break it.

                <li>
                  <h3>Speed</h3>
                  <p>
                    Apple says that the Swift languageâ€™s search algorithms can
                    finish up to 2.6 times faster than those written in
                    Objective-C. Compared to Python 2/7, it is 8.4 times faster.
                    Because of its high-speed capacity, the launching speed of
                    the application will give a better result. So the
                    application user does not need to wait for anything.

                  <h3>Beginner Friendly</h3>
                  <p>
                    If someone starts to learn a programming language there is a
                    traditional road map to start with some programming
                    languages like C, C++, etc. but beginners can easily learn
                    Swift by themselves. If there is any need for clarification,
                    then they can ask professional Swift developers.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Swift is similar to?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Each programming language has its pros and cons but Swift
                    was designed to balance most of the disadvantages of another
                    programming language. These things make this programming
                    language highly preferred forever.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                These are all the excellence of Swift now you will get a better
                idea about why most of the IT industries are requiring Swift
                developers. In the future, the advantages of this programming
                language may be enhanced so that it is better to start a career
                in this field. If you want to have an internship program or
