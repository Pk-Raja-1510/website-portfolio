However, with the emergence of Metaverse, we now have a perfect solution to manage this situation. Metaverse allows for interactive classroom setups where everyone can engage with each other in real-time. For instance, one can virtually establish an educational institution and restrict admission to approved students. With this live interaction, students can pursue their studies from their preferred locations. Even if you don't have a physical educational institution, you can easily create a virtual one within Metaverse. Virtual setups in Metaverse offer low cost and high advantages when compared to physical ones.
