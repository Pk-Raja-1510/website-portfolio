                Have you ever wondered about the various applications of
                blockchain? The truth is, it has numerous use cases and can be
                implemented in almost every industry. One such use case is in
                the procurement lifecycle of any enterprise, known as "Procure
                to Pay" and it requires blockchain innovation for several
                reasons. Blockchain technology can address inefficiencies in the
                PTP cycle, such as manual processes, duplicate data, and the
                need for reconciliation when two businesses engage in a
                transaction that involves the exchange of services and money.
              </p>
              <h2 className={styles.blog_id_main_heading}>The inefficiency of the P2P process:</h2>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                The peer-to-peer (P2P) process can typically be time-consuming
                and problematic for both sellers and buyers. They often operate
                within separate ecosystems and use their own Enterprise Resource
                Planning (ERP) systems, making the P2P process less appealing
                for trading parties. The data transmission is not instantaneous,
                leading to inconsistent outcomes in procurement. Additionally,
                all transactions occur through a centralised process, resulting
                in buyers and sellers having to pay taxes.

                In what ways can blockchain revolutionise the procure-to-pay
                process?
              </h2>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Blockchain is a public ledger that is decentralised and
                distributed, making it challenging to forge, breach, or steal
                information. It enhances transaction and information security
                since the blocks are interconnected through cryptographic hash
                functions.

              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Procure-to-pay, also known as P2P, is the structured set of
                steps involved in the procurement and financial processes for
                purchasing goods and services. The conventional approach to P2P
                has certain limitations, and a blockchain-based P2P solution is
                a perfect option for streamlining the related procedures.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Implementing a blockchain-based P2P process can result in a
                speedy purchase order management process, along with the
                necessary precision, security, and operational efficiency.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Improved Business Liquidity:</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Employing a blockchain-based B2P system for procure-to-pay can
                offer stakeholders instantaneous access to a database that
                stores all pertinent pre-verified information. All purchase
                orders issued by the procurer would be posted on the blockchain,
                and the supplier would have immediate visibility into them. Upon
                receiving the supplies, the procurer would confirm receipt of
                goods on the blockchain platform.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                The system eliminates the need for manual procurement
                verification by providing all necessary pre-verified information
                on the blockchain, It enhances the supplier's liquidity.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Expanding the procurement network:</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Procurement can be challenging for businesses of all sizes but
                can become particularly problematic for larger enterprises.
                Finding the appropriate vendor can be difficult, especially when
                there is an urgent procurement requirement. Failing to identify
                the right vendor can lead to expensive purchasing.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                A procure-to-pay (B2P blockchain solution) can aid companies in
                identifying the appropriate supplier in significantly less time.
                The technology fosters collaboration between various enterprises
                to establish a shared database for procurement purposes.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Managing the risk of unauthorised access:</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                In most companies, the supply chain transactions go unnoticed,
                leading to inefficiencies due to gaps between procurement
                processes. Additionally, the system must address various
                security threats and attacks. However, a blockchain-based B2P
                solution for procure-to-pay can efficiently address these
                concerns.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                By accessing a vast database that caters to various companies,
                the system verifies and authenticates vendors. As a permission
                system, it prevents instances of information breaches and allows
                management to maintain constant surveillance.

              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Adherence to regulations</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Globalisation has resulted in increasingly complex compliance
                requirements for P2P processes. Companies with global operations
                must consider the regulations of numerous countries. However, a
                B2P<a href="/#contact">blockchain solution for the P2P process</a> can ensure
                compliance through the use of smart contracts, which automates
                the system and makes it entirely reliable. This eliminates the
                need for manual compliance efforts, reducing the risk of costly
                errors.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                The immutability feature of blockchain serves as evidence of the
                process. Recording all data and procedures of a company in an
                immutable blockchain creates an audit trail for regulators. The
                technology enables regulators to have read-only, real-time
                access to the organisation's supply chains, practically
                eliminating the possibility of non-compliance.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Procedures to a paperless format</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Implementing blockchain technology in P2P can lead to the
                elimination or reduction of paperwork. By recording everything
                on a distributed ledger that is accessible to everyone on the
                network, the need for a paper trail is eliminated.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                The use of blockchain in procurement can eliminate the need for
                paperwork in the authorization and authentication process.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Saving Time and Reduce Costs</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                By replacing human executives with automated smart contracts,
                processing time can be significantly reduced, and accuracy
                improved in procurement. This helps companies to decrease the
                number of human resources required, leading to a reduction in
                expenses under the salary head.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Businesses can also benefit from cost savings on ancillary
                expenses, such as workstation setup and other support systems.
                The money saved can be redirected towards expanding products and
                services, research and development, or improving the quality of
                goods. Ultimately, this can strengthen a company's position in
                the market over the long term.
