                The current business landscape is witnessing a surge in
                decentralised networks due to the emergence of advanced
                technologies such as Blockchain and cloud computing. These
                decentralised networks have evolved significantly from the
                centralised networks of the past decade. This blog aims to
                educate the fundamental distinctions between network
                environments and highlight their merits and demerits.

                What is a Decentralised Network?
              </h2>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                A decentralised network structure distributes among multiple
                devices instead of relying on a single server. This pattern has
                progressed from the swift developments in desktop and laptop
                computers that provide a performance level surpassing the
                requirements of most business applications. Consequently, the
                surplus computational capacity can be utilised for distributed
                processing.

                How Does a Decentralised Network Work?
              </h2>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                In a decentralised network, users own their data without any
                limitations. All data transfers are recorded on the ledger of
                every user in the network, making it impossible to alter the
                data once it is transferred through the blockchain. This feature
                has made it an ideal choice for developing cryptocurrencies and
                copyright processes. Despite its high level of security, a group
                of reliable tech experts must ensure its regular maintenance to
                keep the decentralised blockchain technology up and running.

                What are Centralized networks?
              </h2>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                A Centralised Network involves a single point connecting all
                nodes, thereby enabling communication control between each node.
                Due to centralised control, service providers can easily detect
                and track all data, making it highly efficient for businesses to
                manage user and customer data. However, this type of network
                also has certain drawbacks. If the central node fails, the
                entire network crashes, and can easily infiltrate the central
                network and alter transactions and data.

                How Does a Centralised Network Work?
              </h2>

              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                A centralised network revolves around a sole server or master
                node that manages critical data processing and stores both user
                information and data accessible by other users. Users can
                connect to the central server through client nodes and request
                data rather than execute them independently.

                Advantages of Centralization:
              </h2>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Common Chain:</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                The command chain is well-specified and centralised. When an
                organisation uses centralization, they are aware of the chain of
                command. This means that everyone in the organisation
                understands their function and to whom they must report. They
                also know who is under their command and are accountable for
                their subordinate's behavior.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                When it comes to a network that uses centralization, one central
                node or a group of nodes is in charge of transactional
                verification.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Reduce Costs:</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                One of the most significant benefits of centralization is the
                reduction in costs. Any centralised network or infrastructure
                demands less support and expenditure. Because centralised
                organisations or networks are planned, the costs associated with
                them do not exceed budgets unless it is absolutely necessary to
                expand the network.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>
                Quick Decision Implementation:
              </h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Without a doubt, centralization organisations or networks allow
                for rapid decision implementation. Because centralised networks
                have fewer nodes or people, there is less communication between
                the various levels of authorization.
              </p>
              <h2 className={styles.blog_id_main_heading}>
                Advantages of Decentralization:
              </h2>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>
                1. Full Access Control
              </h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                One of the top benefits of decentralisation is that users have
                full control over their transactions. This means they can
                initiate a transaction whenever they want without requiring
                authorization from a centralised authority. To put it simply,
                the verification process is not reliant on third parties, and a
                decentralised network uses consensus mechanisms to validate the
                information.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>
                2. Data Can’t be Renamed or Deleted
              </h3>
              <p>
                The data structure of blockchain technology is append-only. This
                means that no one can change or edit the data once it has been
                saved. Another blockchain system that uses other data
                structures, such as Corda, adheres to the immutability property.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>3. Safe & Secure</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Because of how they manage data and transactions, decentralised
                networks are secure. They use cryptography to ensure the
                security of the data ledgers. Furthermore, the data in the
                current block requires data from the adjacent block in order to
                validate the data using cryptography.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>4. Censorship</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Decentralisation entails less censorship. There is a greater
                possibility of information being restricted under a centralised
                system. However, because there is no central authority
                controlling the data, the decentralised network is less
                susceptible to censorship.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>
                5. Open Development
              </h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Decentralised networks generally encourage open development.
                Because of the network's open development environment,
                incredible services, tools, and products are built on top of it.

                Use-Cases of Centralized vs Decentralized
              </h2>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Payment Systems</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                How does a decentralised system used in the payment system? By
                using a decentralised, Your funds are always available because
                there is no central authority or point of failure.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                It also eliminates the possibility of your funds being hacked or
                accessed by a bad person. So, by using cryptocurrencies to
                receive and transmit payments, you remove the function of the
                centralised entity from the process, thereby improving it in
                every aspect.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Another advantage of the payment mechanism is the elimination of
                intermediary expenses.
              </p>
              <h3 className={styles.blog_id_sub_heading}>Voting System</h3>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                The entire voting system scenario revolves around one critical
                issue: transparency. The existing method of voting does not take
                transparency into account. As a result, there are numerous
                conspiracy theories about how the votes are controlled within.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                This is where a decentralised voting platform can help. It can
                be used by governments to administer elections and give
                transparent voting. In this manner, they can put to rest all of
                the speculations that emerge when general election results are
                announced.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Voters can readily verify their votes by utilizing a transparent
                voting system or a voting system that runs on a decentralised
                network. This also means that no party can commit fraud in the
                voting process. Another advantage of this method is that results
                can be announced as soon as voting is completed.
              </p>
              <h2 className={styles.blog_id_main_heading}>
                Conclusion: Centralized vs Decentralized: Which one is better?
              </h2>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Decentralised system network has only been used in a few
                applications, with only technology and banking operation.
                However, the decentralised system is still in its early stages
                and has already demonstrated enormous potential due to its high
                security, transparency and connectivity, and ability to foster
                fairness among its users.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Despite the fact that decentralised systems are not as
                frequently utilised as centralised systems nowadays, they are
                nevertheless employed primarily in the gaming sector, such as
                through NFTs in Play to Earn. With innovative plans like Walk to
                Earn, Step to Earn & Exercise to Earn, the fitness industry
                embraces decentralised solutions. We are convinced that the
                function of decentralised systems will expand and become a key
                part of many sectors in the future.
