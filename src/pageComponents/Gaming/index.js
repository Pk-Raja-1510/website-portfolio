                The evolution of video games reaches its extreme level with the
                help of blockchain technology. The concept of
                <span className={styles.textBold}> NFT Gaming</span> is unique
                when compared to other online games. Here you can earn
                cryptocurrencies and play your desired games with iconic NFT
                characters. This is a vast platform and you can play this game
                only when your device is connected to the internet. Letâ€™s see
                how it completely varies from traditional gameplay.
              </p>
              <h3>NFT Gaming Platform</h3>
              <p>
                Once you enter this gaming platform, it will ask you to connect
                your crypto wallet or you can check the platform as a guest.
                After that, you will get multiple options like Gaming, Events,
                Marketplace, Blog, etc. You can choose your desired option to
                explore. In the event section, you can get the event date and
                reward details. Once you start to play your credits will be
                increased for each level. Those credits will be shared as a
                reward to your crypto wallets.
              </p>
              <h3>Crypto Currency Transaction </h3>
              <p>
                The main advantage of NFT gaming is you can make transactions
                with the players on the same gaming platform. Some NFT gaming
                platforms allow making transactions with players on another
                gaming platform. The players can talk and chat with others so it
                helps to keep in touch with your desired players. The winning
                rewards will be cryptocurrencies, NFT assets, etc.
              </p>
              <h3>Requirements of NFT Gaming Platform </h3>
