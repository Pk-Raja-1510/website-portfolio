                It is essential for all businesses to establish a technical
                infrastructure, such as websites and mobile applications, to
                ensure accessibility for all. However, many business owners
                struggle with selecting the ideal technical support team. In
                this session, we will explore the process of choosing the right
                technical team for your business, and how it can contribute to
                your business's success.
              </p>
              <h3>Technical support for a business</h3>
              <p>
                In the current business landscape, there is a growing desire
                among companies to include a login feature on their website to
                enhance security and restrict access to unauthorized
                individuals. By gathering customers' email addresses through the
                login process, businesses can also notify them of new product
                releases and special promotions. However, static websites lack
                the functionality to support such features and fail to present a
                professional image for a business. Therefore, it is imperative
                for businesses to engage a full-stack technical team to meet
                their technical requirements.
                <br></br>

              <h3>What can the full stack team do for your business?</h3>
              <p>
                A full-stack team typically comprises both front-end and
                back-end developers, as well as a UI/UX design team. The UI/UX
                design team will create a design that incorporates all of your
                requirements, and the front-end developers will use coding to
                replicate this design. Meanwhile, the back-end team will focus
                on connecting user requests to the database. For instance, in an
                e-commerce site, the back-end team will verify product
                availability in the database before allowing customers to
                proceed with the payment process. The back-end is responsible
                for storing 80% of your website data, with the remaining 20%
                residing in the front-end
              </p>
              <h3>
                What are the problems you will face by choosing the front or
                backend team only?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Opting for only front-end developers will eventually require you
                to hire back-end developers as well, which not only prolongs the
                project timeline but also adds additional coordination efforts
                between the two teams. It is, therefore, recommended to hire a
                full-stack team since they are equipped to handle the entire
                project seamlessly. The full-stack team can communicate
                effectively with each other and resolve any issues promptly.
                They are well-trained in both front-end and back-end development
                processes, which helps them avoid wasting time on bug fixes.
              </p>
              <h3>Save more by hiring the fullstack team</h3>
              <p>
                Hiring separate teams for front-end and back-end development
                will result in additional costs and may not yield optimal
                results for your project. Conversely, hiring a full-stack
                development team will enable them to handle the entire technical
                process from start to finish, eliminating the need for
                additional payments. This approach is a cost-effective and
                time-saving strategy for businesses. Experts recommend choosing
                a full-stack team to prevent project delays and excessive
                development costs.
