              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Released in 2005, Django has been a valuable tool for developers
                worldwide in tackling intricate challenges and building
                impressive projects. This Django open-source framework is based
                on Python, and it has remained relevant for 16 years.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.blog_id_content}>
                Django adheres to the model-template-view (MTV) architectural
                pattern, which separates the data, layout, and logic components
                in web applications and large-scale projects. This approach is
                particularly advantageous, as it allows developers to work with
                each component independently and in a more organised manner.
